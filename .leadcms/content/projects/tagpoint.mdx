Smart CMMS Platform

## Overview

TagPoint is a QR-code-powered maintenance management system (CMMS) for facilities and assets. It allows businesses (from office complexes to hotels) to log service requests, schedule preventive maintenance, and track assets all in one place. The system is easy-to-use for both managers and field technicians, employing smartphone QR code scans to streamline operations.

## Role & Contributions

As Co-founder and CTO of TagPoint, I oversaw the development of the platform from scratch. I guided the product strategy to focus on simplicity and mobile-first design for field teams. I led a distributed development team to build features like the QR code check-in system for maintenance tasks, real-time notification workflows, and an analytics dashboard for facility managers. I also coordinated closely with early clients in the hospitality and corporate sectors to refine the product-market fit.

## Key Features & Achievements

* **End-to-End Maintenance Workflow:** Users can scan a QR code at an asset's location to instantly log a service request, which our system turns into a trackable work order - eliminating paperwork and phone calls.
* **Preventive Maintenance Scheduling:** Implemented a scheduler for routine inspections and maintenance tasks, enabling companies to fix issues proactively rather than reactively.
* **Customer Interaction Module:** Developed features for customer feedback and announcements, so facilities can loop occupants into the maintenance process (e.g., notify residents of upcoming repairs).
* **Fast Deployment:** Delivered TagPoint as a cloud service that can be deployed within days for a new client, thanks to a modular setup and configuration toolkit. This drastically reduced onboarding time.
