# LeadCMS.ai

AI-Powered Headless CMS & CRM Platform

## Overview

LeadCMS is an open-source headless CMS and CRM platform that uses AI to accelerate content creation and lead management. It's designed for modern web frameworks – perfect for integrating with Next.js, Gatsby, and others – to build lightning-fast websites with AI-generated content.

## Role & Contributions

As Co-founder and CTO, I drive the product vision and engineering for LeadCMS. I architected the backend in .NET for high performance and scalability, and implemented key features like the RESTful API and plugin system. I'm also hands-on with integrating AI features – for example, connecting OpenAI's GPT models to enable one-click content generation and smart content optimization within the CMS.

## Key Features & Achievements

* **AI Content Generation:** Built-in AI tools that can generate and optimize web content on the fly, reducing content creation time dramatically.
* **Unified CMS+CRM:** Combines content management with customer data tracking – e.g., automatic lead enrichment and journey tracking – into one platform.
* **Open Source & Extensible:** LeadCMS is 100% open source (MIT licensed) and modular. I ensured developers can easily extend it via a plugin architecture or by forking the source.
* **Rapid Deployment:** Provided Docker-based deployment for quick setup (just one command to get started), which helps teams try the platform in minutes.
