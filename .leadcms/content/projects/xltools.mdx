# XLTools.net

Excel Productivity Suite

## Overview

XLTools is an Excel add-in that supercharges productivity for business users inside Excel. It provides a suite of 20+ tools and features right on the Excel ribbon, helping users with everything from version control to cleaning data.

## Role & Contributions

As the Founder and CTO of XLTools, I led the end-to-end development of the product. I designed its architecture and implemented core features like the version control for Excel workbooks, a SQL query interface for data merging in Excel, and a one-click PDF export feature. I also established a licensing model and built a support knowledge base for our users.

## Key Features & Achievements

* **Excel Version Control:** Introduced version control, allowing users to track changes in spreadsheets – a capability previously missing in Excel.
* **Popup Calendar:** Developed a Popup Calendar for date picking in cells, making date-entry faster and error-free.
* **Data Cleaning Tools:** Implemented data cleaning tools (remove duplicates, trim spaces, etc.) that cut down manual cleanup time by 80%.
* **User Adoption:** Grew XLTools to tens of thousands of downloads worldwide, with a 4.8/5 average user rating.
