  I am a founding CTO and software architect with nearly 20 years of experience delivering high-impact
  software solutions. My journey spans leading development teams at global tech firms and launching my own
  startups. I specialize in web and backend development, scalable cloud architectures, DevOps automation,
  and AI-driven product innovation. I'm passionate about leveraging the latest technologies - from
  advanced web frameworks to AI tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and Vercel's V0 - to build products
  faster and smarter. Currently, I'm focused on AI-first platforms and exploring cutting-edge concepts
  like Model Context Protocol (MCP), vector embeddings, and agentic AI, with plans to integrate these into
  my upcoming projects.
